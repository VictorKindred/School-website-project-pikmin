        </header>
        <p>Pikmin 1 follows the story of <b>Captain Olimar</b> as he finds himself crash landing onto a mysterious planet resembling Earth. His ship, the 
        S.S. Dolphin, has broken into piecces thanks to the meteor that collided with it in space leading to the crash landing. With only 30 days 
        worth of air supply in his suit, Captain Olimar has to find a way to repair his ship and leave the hostile planet within 30 days. Shortly after
        crashing, Olimar finds a strange red, plant-like ship, called an <b>onion</b>, that shot out a seed. Olimar inspected the strange, now sprouted
        seed, and plucked it out of the ground revealing what is known as a Pikmin. Olimar now has to command these helpful creatures to collect the 
        ship parts so he can restore the ship and travel back home.</p>
